      <p>Hi! I am a Software Engineer from Richmond, VA. I started in the Tech industry when I was living in Miami, FL. A lot has changed since then.</p>
      <p>From there I moved to Dallas, TX and became a System Consultant for a small firm out of Addison.</p>
      <p>I grew up in Richmond, so eventually my life brought me back here, where I began my journey at Capital One.</p>
      <p>While at Capital One I learned about many interesting technologies utilized in and around the Financial Industry. Nothing is cooler than AWS!</p>
      <p>I am new to Software Engineering, but my desire to learn coupled with a strong passion for technology has me very excited for the future!</p>
